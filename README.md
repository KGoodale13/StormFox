# StormFox
This is a fork of https://github.com/nak2/StormFox this version has everything non essential cut out and is optimized
for large servers. It doesn't work in single player and if you're running this on a small server you're probably better off
just using the regular version. This runs almost entirely client side so it puts very little strain on the server. The
client side has been optimized a ton as well so players should notice a FPS increase.
